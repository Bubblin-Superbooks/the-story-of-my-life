were very kind; but I could not help feeling that they spoke more
from a business than a humanitarian point of view. I am sure they

are afflicted like myself shall receive their rightful
inheritance of thought, knowledge and love. Still I could not
shut my eyes to the force and weight of their arguments, and I
saw plainly that I must abandon—'s scheme as impracticable.
