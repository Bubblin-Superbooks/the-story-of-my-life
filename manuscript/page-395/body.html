Teacher said yesterday, that perhaps Mrs. Spaulding would be
willing to let us have her beautiful house, and   thought I
would ask you about it. Do you think Mrs. Spaulding would help
me, if I wrote to her? I shall be so disappointed if my little
plans fail, because I have wanted for a long time to do something
for the poor little ones who are waiting to enter the
kindergarten. Please let me know what you think about the house,
and try to forgive me for troubling you so much.
Lovingly your little friend,</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
