water and soil. After they had all been pressed together for many
thousands of years, the wood grew very hard, like rock, and then

and bark on the coal? Men go down into the ground and dig out the
coal, and steam-cars take it to the large cities, and sell it to
people to burn, to make them warm and happy when it is cold out
of doors.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Are you very lonely and sad now? I hope you will come to see me
