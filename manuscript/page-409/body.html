<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Helen Keller.</h4><blockquote class="  "><p>P.S. Teacher says you want to know what kind of a pet I would
like to have. I love all living things,â€”I suppose everyone does;
but of course I cannot have a menagerie. I have a beautiful pony,
and a large dog. And I would like a little dog to hold in my lap,
or a big pussy (there are no fine cats in Tuscumbia) or a parrot.
I would like to feel a parrot talk, it would be so much fun! but
I would be pleased with, and love any little creature you send
me.
