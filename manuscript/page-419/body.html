<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Buildings And Exhibits</h4><blockquote class="  "><p>GENTLEMENâ€”The bearer, Miss Helen Keller, accompanied by Miss
Sullivan, is desirous of making a complete inspection of the
Exposition in all Departments. She is blind and deaf, but is able
to converse, and is introduced to me as one having a wonderful
ability to understand the objects she visits, and as being
possessed of a high order of intelligence and of culture beyond
her years. Please favour her with every facility to examine the
exhibits in the several Departments, and extend to her such other
courtesies as may be possible.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Thanking you in advance for the same, I am, with respect,
Very truly yours,

President.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
