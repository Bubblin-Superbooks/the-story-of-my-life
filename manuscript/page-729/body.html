Since that time she has always used the word THINK.</p><p>At a later period I began to use such words as PERHAPS, SUPPOSE, EXPECT, FORGET, REMEMBER. If Helen asked, "Where is mother now?" I replied: "I do not know. PERHAPS she is with Leila."</p><p>She is always anxious to learn the names of people we meet in the horse-cars or elsewhere, and to know where they are going, and what they will do. Conversations of this kind are frequent:</p><p>HELEN. What is little boy's name?</p><p>TEACHER. I do not know, for he is a little stranger; but PERHAPS his name is Jack.</p><p>HELEN. Where is he going?</p><p>TEACHER. He MAY BE going to the Common to have fun with other boys.</p><p>HELEN. What will he play?</p><p>TEACHER. I SUPPOSE he will play ball.</p></div> </div>
