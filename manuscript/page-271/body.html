Tuscumbia, Ala., Feb. 24th, 1888.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>My dear Mr. Anagnos,â€”I am glad to write you a letter in Braille.
This morning Lucien Thompson sent me a beautiful bouquet of
violets and crocuses and jonquils. Sunday Adeline Moses brought
me a lovely doll. It came from New York. Her name is Adeline
Keller. She can shut her eyes and bend her arms and sit down and
stand up straight. She has on a pretty red dress. She is Nancy's
sister and I am their mother. Allie is their cousin. Nancy was a
bad child when I went to Memphis she cried loud, I whipped her
with a stick.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>Mildred</blockquote></div> </div>
