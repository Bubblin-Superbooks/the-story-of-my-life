<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">pain and great sorrow; but now I know that
we could never learn to be brave and patient, if there were only
joy in the world.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I am studying about insects in zoology, and I have learned many
things about butterflies. They do not make honey for us, like the
bees, but many of them are as beautiful as the flowers they light
upon, and they always delight the hearts of little children. They
live a gay life, flitting from flower to flower, sipping the
drops of honeydew, without a thought for the morrow. They are
just like little boys and girls when they forget books and
studies, and run away to the woods and the fields, to gather wild
flowers, or wade in the ponds for fragrant lilies, happy in the
bright sunshine.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
