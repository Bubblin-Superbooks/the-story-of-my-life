And we are always most glad of what we not merely see our friends
enjoy, but of what we give them to enjoy. Are we not?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But God does not only want us to be HAPPY; He wants us to be
good. He wants that most of all. He knows that we can be really
happy only when we are good. A great deal of the trouble that is
in the world is medicine which is very bad to take, but which it
is good to take because it makes us better. We see how good
people may be in great trouble when we think of Jesus who was the
greatest sufferer that ever lived and yet was the best Being and
so, I am sure, the happiest Being that the world has ever seen.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>I</blockquote></div> </div>
