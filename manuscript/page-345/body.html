London, August 3, 1890.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>My Dear Helen—I was very glad indeed to get your letter. It has
followed me across the ocean and found me in this magnificent
great city which I should like to tell you all about if I could
take time for it and make my letter long enough. Some time when
you come and see me in my study in Boston I shall be glad to talk
to you about it all if you care to hear.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
