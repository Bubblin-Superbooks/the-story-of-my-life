I need not tell you we had a most delightful time. We visited our
good friends, Mr. and Mrs. Chamberlin, at Wrentham, out in the
country, where they have a lovely home. Their house stands near a
charming lake where we went boating and canoeing, which was great

Chamberlin celebrated the 17th of June by giving a picnic to
their literary friends. There were about forty persons present,

society very much....</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
