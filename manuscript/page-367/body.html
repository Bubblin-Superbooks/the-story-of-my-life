Boston, and the trustees of the Perkins Institution agreed to
admit him to the kindergarten for the blind.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Meanwhile opportunity came to Helen to make a considerable
contribution to Tommy's education. The winter before, her dog
Lioness had been killed, and friends set to work to raise money
